# EasyLinuxScripts

Hi — I'm glad you're here. I started on computers when CDs were a luxury, Windows was the everyday, and a mis-click could feel like a personal betrayal. Switching to Linux years later felt like finally getting the keys to a house I’d been visiting for decades: exciting, liberating, and — I’ll admit — occasionally confusing.

EasyLinuxScripts is my small, ongoing collection of scripts and helpers I wrote for myself (and my friends) during that transition. I add things here as I build them, tidy them up, and imagine how they could save someone else a late-night troubleshooting session. This repo is about empathy first: scripts that do a little heavy lifting while teaching you what they're doing.

## 🚀 Why I made this

When I moved from Windows to Linux I kept stumbling over the same tiny things: installing the right packages, setting up SSH keys, restoring bookmarks, or making a familiar app feel like home. I wrote little utilities to solve those friction points, and after helping a few friends get unstuck, it made sense to keep the scripts in a place others could find and contribute to.

This repo is for the person who wants to learn, not just automate blindly. Each script is a chance to understand why something works — and to gain confidence.

## A short personal note

I love hearing "Oh wow, that just worked" from someone who thought it would be difficult. I also remember the times I broke my setup because I ran a script without reading it. So, you'll find my scripts are conversational in style: clear comments, safe defaults, and an occasional aside like "this part confused me the first time too."

## What you’ll find here

Typical scripts I add:
- Basic setup helpers: create a user, install a set of packages.
- Package helpers: small wrappers to install the same tool on Debian/Fedora/Arch
- Small desktop tweaks to get keyboard shortcuts or default apps feeling familiar
- You can suggest :)

## How I write scripts here (and why)

- Small, single-purpose scripts. One job, one file.
- Human-friendly comments — I explain why, not just what.
- Safety options: --help, --dry-run, --interactive when appropriate.
- Tested on a VM or throwaway environment before I commit.

I want you to be able to read a script and understand the train of thought that produced it.

## Want to contribute?

Yes — please. Things I appreciate:
- Small, focused PRs with a clear use-case and test steps.
- Scripts that explain themselves and include a --help section.
- Notes about which distros you tested on and what worked.
- If a script touches disks or networking, open an issue first so we can discuss safety.

If you're not comfortable creating a PR, open an issue describing the problem you want solved and I can sketch a script.

## License & attribution

Most things here use the MIT License. If you adapt a script, please keep the author header so we remember who helped. I’ll do the same when I use someone else’s work — credit matters.

Thanks for stopping by. If you’re migrating from Windows and feeling unsure, you’re not alone — drop an issue, tell me what caused you the most friction, and I’ll try to add a script or a doc that would have helped me when I started.

Welcome to tinkering, welcome to learning, and most of all: welcome to the open world. 🐧
